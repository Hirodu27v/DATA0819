Final thoughts with Minhaz Kazi
This brings us to the end of our lecture on finding stories with data. Based on what we
discussed, you should be able to create your own reports and dashboards using Google
Data Studio. Join the discussion groups, if you have questions or if you want to share your
own ideas. Make sure to check out the links for additional resources. Also we highly
recommend that you try out the Data Studio online course provided by the Google
Analytics Academy. This will give you an in-depth understanding of the product. Thanks for
joining us. And until next time keep building awesome data stories.
