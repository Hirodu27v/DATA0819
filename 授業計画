The course materials are organized into six weekly modules. Alberto Cairo and Simon Rogers will be the lead instructors for this course and will be joined by a great team of instructors:

Duncan Clark, co-founder of Flourish
Jan Diehm, journalist-engineer, The Pudding
Minhaz Kazi, developer advocate, Google Data Studio
Dale Markowitz, software engineer, Google

Each weekly module will feature videos, presentations, readings, discussion forums, and messages from the instructors. Each module will include both conceptual and practical videos to help enhance your understanding and practical application of the material. There will be a quiz each week to test the knowledge you've gained from the course materials. The weekly quizzes, and weekly participation in the discussion forums, are the basic requirements for earning an optional certificate of participation at the end of the course. 

This course is very flexible, and if you are behind with the materials, you have the entire length of the course to complete them. We do recommend you complete each of the following before the end of each week so you don’t fall behind: 

Video lectures
Readings and handouts/exercises
Participation in the discussion forums
Quizzes covering concepts from video lectures and/or readings
