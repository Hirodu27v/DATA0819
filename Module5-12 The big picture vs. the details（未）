The big picture vs. the details
しかしながら、グラフィックの形式の選択には、さらにいくつかのガイダンスがあります。これはあくまで一般的なルールであり、原則や規則には例外がつきものです。
一般的には、あなたのグラフィックに基づき人々に正確な判断をしてもらうには共通の軸の上にある長さ、高さ、位置を使用するのが適切かつ便利です。
物事を比較したり、時間の経過による変化を把握したり、2変数間の関連性を見たりしたいときは、常に共通の軸を使った位置、高さ、長さなどを使って、データをエンコーディングするようにしてください。
これは他の領域や角度、色などのエンコーディングが役に立たないということではありません。ビジュアライゼーションの目的が正確な見積もりである場合は優れたエンコーディングではありませんが、データの概要を提供することが目的なら、非常に役立ちます。

Area, color, angle, etc. and other encodings that we saw in a previous portion of these
videos, they may be useful in cases such as this one, for example. The purpose of these
maps, these are graphics that were designed by the New York Times to show the results
of a presidential election. As you can see, all these maps use area, color, shade, hue, etc.
to represent the data. So they are not that great for comparisons, for example, to get
accurate estimates or make accurate judgments based on the data. But that is not the
purpose of these visualizations.
The purpose of these visualizations is to give you the big picture of the data. How the
country voted in general, whether, you know, certain regions voted more Democratic or
more Republican. What matters here is not to be able to compare, you know, Florida with
Illinois and Illinois to California or one city to another city or one county to another county.
That doesn't really matter in this particular case. They care more about showing you the
overall picture. The bird's eye view picture of the general overview of the data.
If we wanted, for example, to rank or to compare counties to each other, then we should
not use a map. We should use some sort of bar graph or something like that, which is
much more appropriate to visualize rankings or to visualize comparisons. But in this
particular case, it's just an overview of the data. Therefore, area, color shapes, color hues
are actually quite good to give you an overall impression of the data.
Now what happens though, when the purpose of the visualization is multiple? Or when you
want both to sort of give an overview of the data, and also you want people to get an
accurate judgment of the data? When you want to sort of, for example in a case like this,
first show the entirety of the United States, more Democratic vote, more Republican vote.
But then you want people to be able to rank and compare counties to each other.
A single visualization will not do the trick. You will need more than one visualization. You
will need one visualization to provide the big picture and then secondary visualizations to
compare things. Right? You could begin with a map. You could begin with a series of
maps such as these ones. And then you can give me several bar graphs, for example, and
line charts to show their variation over time of Democratic vote and Republican vote.
Those secondary graphics will give me a much more accurate picture of the data. You
begin with a general and then you go to the specifics.
