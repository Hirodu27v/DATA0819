Sharing your Data Studio Report
Now that you've created your first report, let's see how you can share it with other people.
On the top side, there is this share button, and if you click on the arrow right next to it,
you'll see the different sharing options that are available. If you click on "download report,"
you'll be able to download all the pages or selected pages from this report as a PDF.
There are multiple options available here that let you change some settings.
Second, you can embed the report. So if you click on "embed report" and then select
"enable embedding," then you can either embed using Iframes, or you can embed using
this your URL.
Then comes the report link. So if you select this one, you get a single link, and you can
copy this link and share it with other people. Whoever will have access to this link will be
able to view the report from their browser.
Next, we have the scheduled email delivery. If you set this option, you can put in different
e-mail addresses, and pick a certain time and reputation: daily weekly or monthly. This will
enable Data Studio to send out a PDF copy of the e-mail to the designated e-mail
addresses on the interval and repetition that you scheduled for.
And finally, you can send invites to specific people by email address, and you can share
access with them to either "view" or "edit." So if you share edit access with other people to
this interface, the other people will be able to come into your report and edit the report at
the same time in a collaborative environment. You can use this same interface to also
enable or disable link sharing, where anyone with the link might be able to view the report
or anyone with the link might be able to edit the report. So, it will just enable anyone with
the link to view. That means if we copy this link and share it with someone else, they'll be
able to use this link to view the dashboard and then interact with it.
