Defining visualizations 
それでは、クラスの概要を説明していきます。まずビジュアライゼーションとは何かを定義します。次に、データ・ビジュアライゼーションのさまざまなコンポーネントについて。
３番目のステップでは、どのようにしてビジュアライゼーションが嘘をつくか少しお話しします。これは私の著書「チャートは嘘をつく」に関連した内容です。
最後に、アイデアを伝えるビジュアライゼーションに適用される、デザインの重要な原則について学びます。
前述したように、データ・ビジュアライゼーションはデータをオブジェクトにマッピングしたものです。
これらのオブジェクトにデータがマッピングされると、表現しようとしているデータに応じてオブジェクトの性質は変化します。何を言わんとしているのか？すぐ説明します。
データ・ビジュアライゼーションの目的は、人々がデータから意味を抽出できるようにすることです。日々スプレッドシートなどで目にする数字から洞察を引き出すツールなのです。
可視化は、眼鏡のようなものです。眼鏡を外すと視界がぼやけます。眼前にこの道具を装着することで、はっきり見えるようになります。
データ・ビジュアライゼーションも同じです。それは複雑なデータをはっきり見えるようにします。ここまで見てきたようにデータ・ビジュアライゼーションはデータの探索に使うことができます。
それだけでなく、データに基づいてアイデアを伝達することにも使えるのです。それについては、このモジュールで説明していきます。
ビジュアライゼーションはデータの探索や発見、コミュニケーションに使われます。基本的な考え方は共通しています。私たち人間は、大量のデータからパターンやトレンドを見出すのは苦手なのです。
いま画面に表示しているのは西暦1000年から2000年までの世界の気温に関するとても大規模なデータセットです。摂氏表示で、平均気温と比較してあります。この平均気温とは20世紀の1961～1980年までの平均を算出したものです。
したがって、このデータセットは正の値と負の値で構成されています。
If I showed you this data said, if I give you, for example, the Excel spreadsheet, the data is put into, and I ask you questions based on this data, it will be very hard for you to answer those questions. For example, let's suppose that I show you this data, and I ask you, "Was the average global temperature in 2000, in the year 2000, higher or lower than it was in the year 1000?". 
Well, if you want to answer that question based on the dataset, you will need to open the Excel spreadsheet. Go to the top of the spreadsheet. Take a look at the temperature of the year 1000. Then scroll down, all the way down, in the spreadsheet. Take a look at the last number on the data set, and then compare mentally – in your brain – one number to the other number and see which one of them is higher than the other. 
Spoiler alert: The average temperature in 2000 was higher than the average temperature in 1000. Right? But the question is hard to answer. I'm forcing you to open the data set and then scroll up and down. Right? It's hard. 
Now let me pose to you an even harder question. Let's suppose again that I show you this data set, and I ask, "Has at any point in the past 1000 years the average temperature been higher than it was in the year 2000, which is the latest year in this particular data set?" That is a much harder question to answer. I am forcing you to again open up the data set, scroll up and down, read every single number, and see if whether any of them is higher than the latest number of the data set. That's very hard to do. 
But what about if instead of showing you the data, I transform, I map these data into certain objects. Right? And I transform those objects in proportion to the data that I have on my data set. In other words, if I transform these data into a line chart. Right? The data that I was showing you is the data behind one of the most famous data visualizations designed during the 20th century. It's commonly called the hockey stick chart. And the story that the hockey stick chart tells us is that in the past, between the year 1000 up to the year 1900 more or less, global temperatures varied. That would be the black line that you see in the middle. Global temperatures varied, but they varied within a certain range. And it's only after the year 1900 that global temperatures started spiking up very, very rapidly. Right? That's the story that the chart conveys. It's the pattern that we didn't see before when we were looking at the numbers. But that pattern becomes evident, becomes visible, becomes unavoidable once we map those numbers into objects, and we transform all these numbers into a particular chart. This chart, by the way, contains tons of layers of information. 
First of all, you will see that there is a blue line. The blue line are our estimates of temperatures, right, for every year in the past. And I say estimates because obviously we don't have records of temperatures from the year 1000 or from the year 1500. What climate scientists do to estimate what the temperature was in the past is to take a look at proxy variables. 
Variables that we can explore and that can tell us something about the variable that we want to learn about. Right? If we don't have direct access to the temperature of a particular year, what we could do, for instance, is to take a look at growth patterns of tree rings. If you cut a tree and you take a look at the rings inside, based on the width and the distances between those rings, you can sort of estimate what temperature that particular tree was experiencing at each point in time. So if you have a very old tree, you can sort of have a map of global temperatures of the area where that tree grew. Or what the temperature was in that particular place. In any case, blue line is the estimates based on these proxy variables. And then the red line. The red line is actual records of temperatures, beginning I believe in the 18th century. In the middle of the 18th century, 19th century, we have actual records of temperatures, and that's the red line. 
The black line that you see in the middle, that's called the smooth. Right? It's sort of the average direction of the data. It's a line that was added to make it more evident what the directionality of the data is, whether it goes up or it goes down. Because as you can see, both the blue lines and the red lines, they're both very squiggly. Right? They go up and down like that. It seems almost random. And then the gray area behind the lines, that's the level of uncertainty of the data. Obviously, if you're using proxy variables to estimate something that you want to analyze. If you use a proxy variable, there will be a lot of uncertainty around that. But once you have, that's the reason why the gray area is so wide, so large in the past. But that gray area, that level of uncertainty, becomes narrower and narrower and narrower the closer we get to the present because once you have actual records of temperatures, that level of uncertainty becomes much, much smaller. 
This is the power of data visualization. The power of letting you see patterns, trends, stories that may go unnoticed if you only take a look at the row numbers or the actual figures on your data set. Once you transform those into some sort of chart, you will be able to see those stories immediately.
