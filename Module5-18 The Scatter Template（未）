The Scatter Template
このビデオでは、分散図のテンプレートについてさらに詳しく説明します。このテンプレートは、おそらくFlourishテンプレートの中で最も使用されています。
私たちはテンプレートを開発するとき、よくこんな冗談を言います。「散布図に追加できるかもね」。
なぜなら、散布図は実に多くのことが出来るからです。テンプレートの選択画面から始めたいと思います。
これらは散布図から派生したグラフです。見かけは様々ですが、散布図のテンプレートから作ることが出来ます。ここにないのはビースウォームプロットくらいでしょう。
散布図の構造を説明し、作例がどのように作られているかお見せします。しかしあなたは一からグラフを作らなくても大丈夫です。
基本の図にデータを取り込んでから散布図を作成し、列の設定を行います。いいガイドがあります。
基本的な散布図から始めましょう。多くの国の一人当たりGDPと平均余命を示しています。それぞれの点が国を表しています。
これをお見せしたいのは基本的な散布図とバブルチャートの違いを示すためです。
散布図のテンプレートでは設定パネルが細々としているので気が遠くなりそうです。しかし心配はいりません。
複雑なチャートを作るのでなければ触れる必要がないのです。これは一人当たりのGDPと平均余命を軸にしたXY散布図です。
大陸や地域ごとに色分けしています。他の全てを無視するとXの値はGDPに従い、Yの値は平均余命です。
各点に名前をつけて地域ごとの色を与えますが、この二つの設定を取り除くと通常のXY散布図と変わりません。
すでに色などについては説明したとおりですが、これは基本的な散布図です。バブルチャートにする場合は三つ目のディメンションの値を入力する必要があります。
これによってバブルの大きさが決まります。これがサイズの設定です。この列をEにします。ここまで触れてこなかった人口をサイズで表します。
このようにすれば、人口はバブルのサイズに反映されるはずです。
A couple of setting things to know about the dots, you can kind of change the color palette
like normal here, but you can also change in the style. So I like to do low opacity for the
dots because, especially if you're using a color palette that's a bit darker, so you can see
where the overlaps are. I think it looks quite nice. You can also add a bit of an outline to
the dots if you want. I like to keep that quite minimal just to give them a bit of dimension to
them. But yes, that's just sort of a basic bubble chart. There are starting points for basic
scatter and bubble charts, so you should be totally fine making those. The other thing I
want to point out before I move on, on this template is that we're currently on the x axis
using a logarithmic scale, log scale, just to point out that you can do stuff like that in this
chart.
OK, so the next one is a strip plot. And this just sort of shows, it's a good way to sort of
display data by category and one other variable. It's something that database people, a
chart type that they really like to use. So we have it in this template as well.
The binding that you're going to be using for that is going to be this series connect with line
binding, but before I talk about that, we should talk about what the X and Y values are. So
to make this possible, you see that the X value is this sort of numeric value, and then the Y
value is going to be a categorical value. So it's going to be a category of like Europe and
Central Asia. And that's what makes these sort of lines here along the Y axis. And then the
X value sort of places the dots along there. And you'll see that these are actual like
countries and stuff. So that is what the C column is doing there with name.
And then to make these connect. So if I get rid of this and watch this here in the corner, if I
get rid of this, it doesn't really do very much, but what it's doing is kind of like making these
into a category and it's connecting them with a line. So this makes more sense if you look
at it on the dot plot, actually. But just know that the strip plot is basically you have one
categorical variable and then one numeric variable, and you can do the same with
changing the opacity and everything with these. These definitely having lower opacity is
really quite useful, I think, because there's lots of interesting overlap between the dots
often.
So now I'm moving on to the dot plot. Here's another example. This is like a very similar
chart. So you have this along the x axis, you have this sort of numeric value and then the
Y axis is the category. But the y axis, make sure you understand in this one, is also the
name. So instead of having one sort of category and then placing named dots along it, like
in the strip plot, in this we have the category and then we're placing two other data points
along it for that same category. So in this case, we have the country, and then we have the
year and the income in that year, and we're connecting them with the dot, if that makes
sense. So 2014 and 2004.
And make sure you have this series. In this case, we're not actually connecting by the
value like we did in the other one. We're connecting on the country. So if you want this to
be by country, make sure that that is the column that you have in this series connect with
line. So if I get rid of that, it removes the lines. It just has the dots placed along, sort of like
we had in the strip plot. If we put it back, it sort of draws the line between them. And
there's all sorts of styling options. There's all sorts of styling options for the line and stuff
like that.
The second to last one that I'm going to show you is the distribution option, and that is the
box, violin, and beeswarm plots. So basically all you need to do for these is to enter X and
Y values. Your X value is most likely going to be a sort of category again, as you can see.
And then the Y values are going to be like the value of, from each of those categories,
some sort of value. And these are great to sort of show the distribution of values across
different categories. So unlike in the strip and dot plots, you're usually going to have your
categorical variables along the X and then your values, your numeric values, are going to
be the Y.
And if you go on the settings panel to this box, violin, and beeswarms, these are all just
sort of different, more sort of statistical options, visualization options that science and
statistics people like to use to show distribution. So we have beeswarm, which is where
you kind of beeswarm out the values. And then you also have, so you can see they're
actually on top of each other here, and when you beeswarm, it spreads them out to make
them look kind of like a beeswarm.
And then you can also have, we can also have the box plot to sort of show the median
distribution, and then you can also have a violin plot, which is kind of similar to a
beeswarm, if you show them, it kind of outlines the beeswarm basically. So those are kind
of advanced options and they're not something that a lot of people use, but if you're sort of
into science and statistics, they're definitely useful and they're there for you.
And then finally, I just want to show this because I'm not really going to explain it, it's kind
of complicated. But we also have this Hans Rosling, which was a famous statistician, and
this chart just sort of animates through different years and shows different points of
development of different countries in the world. And this is an option. You do a lot of it here
in this time slider. And there's this extra time binding column setting here that you have to
use. I'm not going to really show it to you now, because if you're into this, you'll be able to
figure it out.
But that's kind of a nice place to end. This is probably going to be the longest video
because this is kind of our most versatile template, but once you know what it can do, it's
really quite powerful. And so thanks for listening.
