What is data storytelling? 
みなさんこんにちは。私はジャン・ディーム。The Puddingのジャーナリスト・エンジニアをしています。私たちは６～８人のジャーナリスト・エンジニアの集団で、ビジュアルストーリーを発信しています。
今日お話しするのはデータ・ストーリーについてです。どうすればよいデータ・ストーリーができるのでしょうか。それらがどのようなものか、また私たちはどう作っているのかを併せてお伝えします。
Module６に入りました。まず、データ・ストーリーテリングとは何なのでしょうか。The Puddingのサイトトップで「我々は文化の中で議論されたアイデアをビジュアルで伝えるデジタル出版である」と宣言しています。
これはかなりラフな定義です。人に説明するときには携帯電話を取り出してサイトを直に見てもらった方が早いのです。しかし、私たちがどんなデータ・ストーリーテリングをしているのか厳密に説明できなくてもいいのです。常にそれは進化し続けているのですから。
Sometimes it's almost easier to describe what other types of data visualizations exist out there in order to define what data storytelling is. First, there's data academia and data science. We're thinking, you know, those black and white bar graphs that you see stuck inside of scientific papers. These are often really complex and hard to decipher. The average public just doesn't really connect with them. Historically, that's because scientists had to pay per figure in their paper so they would cram in as much information as they could. And that would make these things really, really complex. 
On the other side, there's data art. This is something that's on the opposite end of the spectrum. Here the data often doesn't look like a traditional chart or graphic at all. Instead, it's something that looks like it belongs in a museum. It's engaging and it's captivating. Here we're looking at a constellation of the royal family, where you can see kind of the familial connections between all of these royalty. Another great example of this data art is Giorgia Lupi's Latour project, and it's another project that is rooted in data but presented more as art. 
Data storytelling itself exists in the sweet spot between the two. It combines the function of academic and science data with the form of data art. It's sometimes described as edutainment because it both informs and delights. And what differentiates data storytelling is that your goal is to reach the broadest audience possible and to communicate a clear narrative and clear takeaways. 
Next, I'm gonna show you a quick video of some of The Pudding's work to give you an idea of what our data storytelling looks like. And I'll catch up with you guys in the next video. We will run through a brief history lesson of how we got to where we are today.
