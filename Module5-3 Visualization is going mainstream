Visualization is going mainstream
データのトレンドやパターン、ストーリーを発見するのに大きな力を発揮するビジュアライゼーションは、今や黄金時代を迎えつつあります。
データ･ビジュアライゼーションは科学、統計、ビジネス分析、メディアで幅広く使われています。とりわけ報道機関ではここ10～15年の間に多用されるようになりました。
米のニューヨーク･タイムズやワシントン･ポスト、英のフィナンシャル･タイムズやガーディアン、独のベルリン・モルゲンポスト、スペインのエル・ディアリオ、ブラジルのフォーリャ・ジ・サンパウロなど身近なところにあります。
データ･ジャーナリズムやデータ･ビジュアライゼーションをますます活用しているメディアは他にもたくさんあります。
There's a very good reason why this is happening in news media, I believe. And it is the fact that through our analytics, we can sort of see that readers really like data visualization. Once you put a chart, a map, a diagram, an infographic into a story or into a social media post, it is very likely that the engagement and the reading time of that particular piece is going to increase. Actually, one factoid, a factoid that I can mention is that one of the most popular stories, if not the most popular story ever published by The New York Times online, is a data visualization. You can find it just by Googling it up. It's called the dialect map. The map of dialects in the United States. If you Google "New York Times dialect map," you will find it. That's one of the most popular pieces of content or story ever published by The New York Times online. 
That tells you something. People really like to see data. People really like to see maps, and charts, and graphs, if those pieces are well-designed. There is another factor, by the way. And this connects to sort of what we say in the introduction to this course in Module 1. You may remember that in Module 1, I refered to the work of Professor Hans Rosling from Sweden. The author of a book called "Factfulness," and also author of the website "Gapminder.org," which is also a foundation. 
I believe that Rosling is an example of what we could call popular risers. People who have brought data visualization to the general public, telling the general public, "Hey, all these charts, and graphs, and maps, et cetera. They are not just useful for specialists. They're not just useful for statisticians and scientists like myself. They can be useful for you. They can basically help you understand the world, information much better than you did before. So you should pay attention to all these graphs and maps that you see every day in news media and any many other sources.". I believe that the work of Rosling and many other popular rises of data visualization has been fundamental.
